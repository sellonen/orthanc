Palantir - A Lightweight, RESTful DICOM Server
==============================================


Dependencies
------------

Palantir uses CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) to automate its building
process. You thus have to download and install CMake first.

For the native build under Windows, you will also need to download and
install 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/).

The other third party dependencies are automatically downloaded by the
CMake scripts. The downloaded packages are stored in the
"ThirdPartyDownloads" directory.


Building Palantir at a glance
-----------------------------

To build Palantir, you must:

1) Download the source code (either using Mercurial, or through the
   released versions). For the examples below, we assume the source
   directory is "~/Palantir".

2) Create a build directory. For the examples below, we assume the
   build directory is "~/PalantirBuild".



Native Linux Compilation
------------------------

To build binaries with debug information:

# cd ~/PalantirBuild
# cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ~/Palantir
# make
# make doc


To build a release version:

# cd ~/PalantirBuild
# cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ~/Palantir
# make
# make doc


Under Linux, you have the possibility to dynamically link Palantir
against the shared libraries of your system, provided their version is
recent enough. This greatly speeds up the compilation:

# cd ~/PalantirBuild
# cmake -DSTATIC_BUILD=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ~/Palantir
# make

 

Cross-Compilation for Windows under Linux
-----------------------------------------

To cross-compile Windows binaries under Linux using MinGW, please use
the following command:

# cd ~/PalantirBuild
# cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Palantir/Resources/MinGWToolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ~/Palantir
# make



Native Windows build with MinGW
-------------------------------

# cd [...]/PalantirBuild
# cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG [...]/Palantir
# mingw32-make
